To'observe its chaotic behaviors, its bifuucation diagram and L~apunov Exponent are presented in
Fig. 2(a) and Fig. 3(a). In the bifurcation diagram shown in Fig. 2(a), the dotted line shows its'good chaotic
behavior and the solid line represents its non-chaotic property. There are two problems in the Logistic map.
First, its chaotic range is limited only within [3.57, 4]. Even within this range, there are some parameters
which make the Logistic map to have no dhaotic behaviors. This is verified by the blank zone in its bi-
furcation diagram and plot of the Lyapunov Exponent in Fig. 3(a). For the Lyapunov Exponent, a positive
value means a good chaotic property of a chaotic map. Fs shown in Fig. 3(a), the Lyapunov Expoients
of the Logistic map are smaller than'zero when parameter r < 3.57. Second, the data range of the chaotic
